<p>Recently I have been playing around with AI and Deep-Learning and I came out with this idea about DL applied to financial markets. Turns out that there are PLENTY of people already doing that out-there, here is a non-comprehensive list:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@TalPerry/deep-learning-the-stock-market-df853d139e02">'deep-learning-the-stock-market', Tal Perry</a></li>

  <li>'Artificial neural networks apporach to the forecast of stock market price movements', Di Persio, Honchar, 2016</li>
</ul>
<p> After an intensive summer-school about DL and intensive reading of papers about the topic I decided to start my own project: here we are.</p>

  <p>So after extensive reading of already existing implementation on the web about RNN to fin markets I am bit disappointed. Most of the time people have no idea what they are speaking about either because they don't know anything about finance or because they don't know anything about the foundation of Deep Learning (or both). On the other hand, what excites me most is that there are plenty of papers about people claiming to predict stock prices with accuracy from 65% to 80%, that is impressive. So my guideline is to try to implement those RNN models in my application, and apply the prediction to some financial instruments. Currently I would go for binary options, it seems fitting pretty well with the RNN prediction capabilities. There are two main types of approach to the problem:<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>(A) Regression problem</b>: the most straightforward, given the last Ndays predict tomorrow closing price.</li>
    <li><b>(B) Classification problem</b>: given the last Ndays, will the price tomorrow goes up or down? (binary classification).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Full of example of (A) on the internet, and the truth it that they don't work so well. Anyway since they are relatively easy to impelement I gave it a try and here is the outcome.</p>
