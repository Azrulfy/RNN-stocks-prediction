<p>Recently I have been playing around with AI and Deep-Learning and I came out with this idea about DL applied to financial markets. Turns out that there are PLENTY of people already doing that out-there, here is a non-comprehensive list:</p>

  <li>'Recurrent neural networks approach to the financial forecast of Google assets', Di Persio, Honchar, 2017</li>
  <li>'Artificial neural networks apporach to the forecast of stock market price movements', Di Persio, Honchar, 2016</li>
</ul>
<p> After an intensive summer-school about DL and intensive reading of papers about the topic I decided to start my own project: here we are.</p>
